## 🗃️ The Course Database

We use a realistic **retail and sales dataset** throughout the entire course.

The database includes **8 tables**:

| Table | Description | Rows |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `customers` | Customer profiles with demographics | 1,000 |
| `products` | Product catalog with categories and pricing | 500 |
| `categories` | Product category hierarchy | 25 |
| `orders` | Order header — date, customer, status | 10,000 |
| `order_items` | Order line items — product, quantity, price | 35,000 |
| `employees` | Employee hierarchy — managers and reports | 150 |
| `stores` | Store locations and region mapping | 20 |
| `sales_targets` | Monthly targets by store and category | 480 |

> This is not a toy dataset. It has real-world messiness — NULLs, duplicates, inconsistent formatting — because that is what real data looks like.

## 📝 How Each Day Is Structured

Every day folder contains the same four files:

### `queries.sql`
Every query written during the video, in order, with comments explaining each one. If you missed something in the video — it is here.

```sql
-- ─────────────────────────────────────
-- DAY 1: Your First SELECT Statement
-- BI to AI YouTube Channel
-- ─────────────────────────────────────

-- Basic SELECT
SELECT *
FROM customers;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email
FROM customers;
```

### `exercises.sql`
Practice problems at three difficulty levels. Try them before looking at solutions.

```sql
-- ══════════════════════════════════════
-- DAY 1 EXERCISES
-- ══════════════════════════════════════

-- BEGINNER ──────────────────────────
-- Exercise 1: Write a query that returns
-- all columns from the products table.
-- Your answer:


-- INTERMEDIATE ──────────────────────
-- Exercise 2: Return only the product_name
-- and unit_price for products where
-- unit_price is greater than 50.
-- Your answer:


-- ADVANCED ───────────────────────────
-- Exercise 3: Return customer first name,
-- last name, and email for all customers
-- from Texas, ordered by last name A to Z.
-- Your answer:
```

### `solutions.sql`
Complete solutions with explanations and common mistakes called out.

### `README.md`
Day-specific notes, the video link, and the AI/ML bridge connecting that day's SQL skill to machine learning.

## 🤖 The AI/ML Bridge — Why SQL Matters for AI

Every day in this course ends with a section connecting SQL to its application in AI and ML. Here is the full picture:

| SQL Skill | AI/ML Application |
|-----------|------------------|
| SELECT + WHERE | Filtering training data before model ingestion |
| Aggregations | Computing statistical features (mean, std dev, counts) |
| Joins | Assembling multi-table training datasets |
| CASE WHEN | Creating categorical label columns for classification |
| NULL handling | Data cleaning before ML preprocessing |
| Window functions | Time-series features (lag, rolling averages, rank) |
| CTEs | Modular, readable ML feature pipelines |
| Performance | Fast feature generation on billion-row datasets |
| Feature engineering | Building complete ML-ready training sets in SQL |

> **The insight:** 80% of machine learning is data preparation. SQL is the fastest, most scalable tool for that preparation — faster than Python Pandas on large data, cleaner than manual Excel work, and readable by the entire data team.

## 💡 Tips for Getting the Most Out of This Course

**1. Write every query yourself.**
Do not copy-paste from `queries.sql`. Type it. Your hands need to know this as well as your brain.

**2. Break things on purpose.**
After writing a query, change something and see what breaks. That is how SQL actually sticks.

**3. Do the exercises before looking at solutions.**
Even if you get it wrong — the attempt matters more than the answer.

**4. Use the BI bridge.**
If you come from Power BI or Tableau, compare every SQL concept to its BI equivalent. GROUP BY is a matrix visual. A CTE is a calculated table. These connections accelerate learning.

**5. Ask in the comments.**
Drop your question on the relevant YouTube video. I read and reply to comments, especially in the early days of the channel.
